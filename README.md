# 🎓 Student Management System in C++ with Linked Lists

This project is a small exercise to practice implementing **linked lists** in C++. It simulates a basic **Student Management System** where you can add students, and each student node has their own linked list of grades. Perfect for learning how to manage dynamic memory and linked data structures!

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system uses **linked lists** for two things:
1. **Student List**: A linked list to manage student records.
2. **Grades List**: Each student node has its own linked list to store and manage their grades.

The structure of the project is simple and modular to keep things clean and easy to follow.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- **Main File**: `main.cpp` – The entry point where the system is tested.
- **Student Management System Class Declarations**: `StudentManagementSystem.hpp` – Contains the class definitions and declarations.
- **Student Management System Class Implementations**: `StudentManagementSystem.cpp` – Contains the logic for managing students and their grades using linked lists.

## ✨ Features

- Add students to the system.
- Manage each student's grades through a linked list.
- Simple console-based interaction to demonstrate the functionality.
